</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Data management is a broad term that encompasses collecting, storing,
sorting, organizing and sharing data. We all use some form of data
management in our lives: making to-do lists, putting paperwork in
labeled file folders, organizing photos by trip name. For researchers,
data management is an essential part of the research process that
enables them to make sense of the vast amounts of data they collect.
Data management practices strive to make data FAIR - Findable,
Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable. In other words, good data
management makes it easy to find, understand, and reuse a specific piece
of information again. It also enhances reproducibility by making it
clear what data were used to support which conclusion, and increases
security by keeping track of sensitive information.</p>
We often speak of the research data lifecycle when educating researchers
about data management:
<p align="center">
</p>
<figure><img src="fig/RDM-lifecycle-v5.png" style="width:80.0%" alt="Source: https://zenodo.org/record/8076168" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">Source: <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/8076168" class="external-link uri">https://zenodo.org/record/8076168</a>
</div>
</figure><p>The research data lifecycle represents the stages of data collection,
use, and reuse. How data is managed is integral to each step in the
cycle. For example, when a researcher collects data, they should use
standardized file naming and develop documentation to facilitate its
interpretation and analysis. In order to analyze and collaborate, the
researcher must organize their data and make it comprehensible to
outside parties. In this lesson, we will focus on the data management
plan, which should be composed during the “Plan &amp; Design” stage,
though it can be updated throughout the lifecycle.</p>
<p>The National Center for Data Services (part of the Network of the
National Library for Medicine) defines Data Management Plans in their <a href="https://www.nnlm.gov/guides/data-glossary" class="external-link">Data Glossary</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A Data Management Plan (DMP or DMSP) details how data will be
collected, processed, analyzed, described, preserved, and shared during
the course of a research project. A data management plan that is
associated with a research study must include comprehensive information
about the data such as the types of data produced, the metadata
standards used, the policies for access and sharing, and the plans for
archiving and preserving data so that it is accessible over time. Data
management plans ensure that data will be properly documented and
available for use by other researchers in the future.*</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Data management plans are often required by grant funding agencies,
such as the National Science Foundation (NSF) or National Institute of
Health (NIH), and are ~2-page documents submitted as part of a grant
application process.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A data management plan, sometimes also called a data management and
sharing plan, is generally written by a researcher as part of the
planning process before embarking on a project. Spending the time
writing a DMP itself can clarify how to carry out data management tasks
throughout the entire research data lifecycle. The process also creates
a document that can be shared with lab staff or referenced as needed.
DMPs are considered a living document and should be updated as
circumstances inevitably change through the course of a research
project.</p>

OSTP Memo</a> defines data as “digital recorded factual material
commonly accepted in the scientific community as necessary to validate
research findings including data sets used to support scholarly
publications, but does not include laboratory notebooks, preliminary
analyses, drafts of scientific papers, plans for future research, peer
review reports, communications with colleagues, or physical objects,
such as laboratory specimens (OMB circular A-110)”. This section of a
DMP provides a brief description of what data will be collected as part
of the research project and their formats. Information about general
files size (MB / GB per file) and estimated total number of files can be
helpful. It is not necessary for researchers to describe their

<p><strong>From a project examining the link between religion and sexual
violence:</strong> This study will generate data primarily through (1)
participant observations of support groups for those abused by clergy
and (2) in-depth, semi-structured interviews with these individuals.
Data will be collected via phone calls and video calls hosted on
encrypted and passcode-protected conferencing platforms. Data will be
collected in the form of audio recordings (MP3, collected on an external
recording device free of any network connection), transcriptions of
these recordings, physical notes taken during participant observation
sessions, and any documents (e.g., email correspondences, scanned copies
of letters or photographs) that respondents voluntarily choose to share
with the researchers. All data in this study will be de-identified and
associated with an anonymizing alpha-numeric code. The research team
anticipates that most of these data will be preserved in DOCX, JPG, MP3,
PDF, PNG, TXT, or XLSX format. <a href="https://dmptool.org/plans/48540/export.pdf?export%5Bquestion_headings%5D=true" class="external-link">Source</a>

<p>Metadata is information that describes, explains, locates,
classifies, contextualizes, or documents an information resource (<a href="https://www.nnlm.gov/guides/data-glossary/metadata" class="external-link">NNLM</a>).
Succinctly, metadata is data about data. A library catalog entry is an
example of metadata. Metadata is compiled according to different
standards: Dublin Core is an example of a general metadata schema. There
are also specific metadata standards for different types of data: for
example, MIAME and MINSEQE are commonly used for genomic data. We will
discuss data standards further in Episode 2. This section provides
information about what standards will be used, giving context to the
data generated for easier interpretation and reuse. Often,
discipline-specific data repositories will specify a particular metadata
standard for their platform.</p>

<p>The data timeline includes information about when data will be
backed-up, preserved, and published. Some agencies specify in their
policies when the dataset must be shared, such as at the end of the
reporting period (the active research phase). In addition to specifying
their timelines, this section requires researchers consider what
measures they need to take to ensure data security. Raw data may include
identifiers such as PII or sensitive information such as location of
endangered species that should be protected during collection and
processing. Examples of good security practices include using access
restrictions such as passwords, encryption, power supply backup, and
virus and intruder protections. Active storage location and appropriate
software will depend on data sensitivity level. In addition, before
sharing any sensitive data with collaborators or depositing into a
repository, the dataset should be de-identified or aggregated.</p>

<p>Access refers to where the data will be made publicly available, and
includes a justification why the repository chosen will help with
dissemination, preservation, and reuse. In this section, researchers
should also consider if their data will need to be embargoed, or if
their dataset can only be published in a controlled access repository.
Controlled access repositories require some form of verification before
data can be accessed, and are commonly used for human subject research
data. In addition, this section includes information on who can reuse
the data, typically indicated by a license, and if reuse requires a <a href="https://dataverse.org/best-practices/sample-dua" class="external-link">data use (DUA) or
data sharing agreement (DSA)</a>. In the event that data cannot be
shared due to its sensitive nature, the researcher can use this section
to specify why the dataset will not be published, including any ethical
or legal issues around sharing data.</p>

<p><strong>For a project developing a diagnostic test to acne-causing
bacteria</strong>: We will maintain a one-year embargo on data to
organize and archive it, performing quality assurance checks prior to
making in publicly available on one of the data sharing sites. Some
species detected may be listed as endangered (Atlantic sturgeon, right
whales) and these locations may not be publicly listed until management
agencies have been notified and can protect the species involved.
Intellectual property rights will reside with the persons identifying
the species detected in passive acoustic data using data classification
algorithms or by listening to the sounds. Identified species will have
sample sound recordings deposited in the Macaulay Library of Natural
Sounds (<a href="http://macaulaylibrary.org/" class="external-link uri">http://macaulaylibrary.org/</a>). Geographic data of tracks
of the AWG will be made publicly available as part of the ECU Coastal
Atlas (<a href="http://www.ecu.edu/renci/Focus/NCCoastalAtlas.html" class="external-link uri">http://www.ecu.edu/renci/Focus/NCCoastalAtlas.html</a>).

with CTD data as separate voltage channels into one file. Files will
comprise a line of text for every second measurement, so if complexed

<p>As librarians, we use a variety of resources to answer researchers’
questions, such as library databases like ERIC or PsycInfo, or reference
sources like Credo. When answering data management plan questions, you
will use a new set of resources. In this lesson, we will introduce you
to places to find data management planning information to answer common
researcher questions.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>Funders are increasingly including DMPs in their requirements for
grant applications. Due to the 2022 Ensuring Free, Immediate, and
Equitable Access to Federally Funded Research memo, colloquially known
as the “<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/08-2022-OSTP-Public-access-Memo.pdf" class="external-link">Nelson
Memo</a>”, all federal granting agencies in the US are required to
establish data sharing policies. When assisting a researcher writing a
DMP for a grant application, the first step is to get a handle on the
funder’s requirements for the plan.</p>
<p>Here are some places to check for funder requirements:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>The funding announcement.</strong> Most grant programs
create an announcement, which may be called by any of a number of
acronyms such as a “CFP” (call for proposals) or “NOFO” (Notice of
funding opportunity) to publicize their funding opportunity. After
navigating to the funding announcement, you can scan through the
associated links to look for information on their data management plan
requirements. Below, you can see the information provided in a National
Institutes of Health Notice of Funding Opportunity:<br><img src="fig/Copy%20of%20NIH%20NOFO%20DMP%20info.PNG" alt="NIH NOFO DMP info.png" class="figure"><br>
In case the funding announcement does not have the information you need,
proceed to the other items on this list.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Funder application instructions or website.</strong>
Large funders will have a website set up to help researchers through the
application process. Looking through the documentation can help you
understand their requirements for data management plans. This example
from the NIH application instructions redirects you to <a href="https://sharing.nih.gov/" class="external-link">sharing.nih.gov</a>, their website
specifically for data sharing: <img src="fig/Copy%20of%20NIH%20application%20instructions.PNG" alt="NIH application instructions.PNG" class="figure"></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://datasharing.sparcopen.org/" class="external-link">The SPARC directory
of data sharing requirements</a> <strong>of federal agencies.</strong>
SPARC stands for the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources
Coalition, and is a non-profit that supports open research and education
systems. Through this website, you can view and compare data sharing
policies from top funding organizations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Google search.</strong> Often googling <em>“[funder
name]” “data sharing requirements” OR “data management plan” OR
“dmp”</em> will direct you to the appropriate documentation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Contact the funder.</strong> If you are still not sure
about what guidance to follow, consider reaching out to the research
office contact in the funding announcement.</p></li>
</ol></section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="example-dmps">Example DMPs<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#example-dmps"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>After locating the funder requirements, researchers may find it
useful to see an example DMP written by others as part of their
application to the same program or funding agency.</p>
<p>Here are some places to check when looking for example DMPs:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>University libguides.</strong> Many research university
libraries have created libguides that provide researchers with guidance
on writing DMPs. Some library resources include boilerplate templates
for specific funding agencies, or successfully funded researcher DMPs.
To find university libguides, you can either search through the <a href="https://community.libguides.com/" class="external-link">LibGuides Community</a> or
search google for DMP AND [funding agency] AND libguide.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>DMPTool.</strong> The <a href="https://dmptool.org/" class="external-link">DMPTool</a> is a free online application
that helps guide researchers through writing plans, and even allows
librarians to provide feedback along the way. The website <a href="https://dmptool.org/public_templates" class="external-link">maintains templates</a>
based on funder and program requirements, in addition to hosting public
DMPs created by researchers using the DMPTool. In the <a href="https://dmptool.org/public_plans" class="external-link">public DMPs</a> list, you can
narrow your search by funding agency to find relevant examples. We will
explore the DMPTool more in Episode 4.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Funder example DMPs.</strong> Some funding agencies, <a href="https://sharing.nih.gov/data-management-and-sharing-policy/planning-and-budgeting-for-data-management-and-sharing/writing-a-data-management-and-sharing-plan#sample-plans" class="external-link">like
the NIH</a>, have created example DMPs to provide researchers an idea of
what they would like to see as part of their grant applications. In
addition, some granting agencies share data management plans submitted
as part of grant applications through a public repository. An example of
this is the Department of Transportation’s (DOT) <a href="https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/gsearch?collection=&amp;terms=DMP+data+management+plan" class="external-link">repository
&amp; open science access portal (rosap)</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Example DMS plans website.</strong> The Working Group on
NIH DMSP Guidance created the <a href="https://example-dms-plans.github.io/examples/" class="external-link">Example DMS Plans
website</a>, which aggregated stable versions of publicly available
DMPs. It was compiled ahead of the rollout of the NIH DMS
Policy.</p></li>
</ol></section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="fair-data-repositories">FAIR Data Repositories<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#fair-data-repositories"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>In data management, we often speak of making data “FAIR.” <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/" class="external-link">FAIR</a> is an acronym
for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable. Using these
principles, we can evaluate the “openness” of a data set. Repositories
should promote these characteristics in order to make data housed there
user-friendly.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.nnlm.gov/guides/data-glossary/repository" class="external-link">NNLM’s data
glossary</a>, “a repository is a tool to share, preserve, and discover
research outputs, including but not limited to data or datasets.”
Generally, a data repository is a website that houses a collection of
datasets, making them available to a broad(er) audience. Repositories
manage data sharing infrastructure and provide a stable location for
researchers to share their work.</p>
<p>Why choose a data repository? For most researchers, a data repository
is the best practice for data sharing. Using a personal or lab website
or even uploading the dataset in journal article supplementary files is
not advisable because the long term sustainability of the website is
unknown: it can be updated or taken down without warning. In addition,
simply adding “available upon request” to the data availability
statement in a publication is not sufficient. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S089543562200141X" class="external-link">Studies
have demonstrated</a> a lack of author compliance when data is actually
requested.</p>
<div id="callout1" class="callout">
<div class="callout-square">
<i class="callout-icon" data-feather="bell"></i>
</div>
<div class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">Callout</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>In addition to lack of sustainability, personal websites, article
supplementary files and availability upon request are typically
difficult to find. Data repositories mints DOIs, digital object
identifiers, providing persistent access to data even if it is updated
or moved, and will provide reasoning for removal if the dataset needs to
be taken down. Data repositories also provide structures that link
README files or other metadata schemas to the dataset, allowing for
greater reusability in the future.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Through repositories, several options are available to researchers
for data sharing:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Public access.</strong> Public datasets are available to all
without restriction. This is commonly used for animal studies or data
without privacy concerns.</li>
<li>
<strong>Controlled access.</strong> In a controlled access
repository, researchers must verify their identity before they are
allowed to download and analyze data. This can take the form of
verifying a university-associated email address, signing a data use
agreement, or sending in an application before access is granted. Some
repositories, such as Vivli, which specializes in clinical trial data,
require that sensitive data be analyzed in a controlled cloud computing
environment. Others, like ICPSR, may require that their restricted
datasets be accessed on-site, using a computer not connected to the
internet.</li>
<li>
<strong>Embargoes.</strong> Most repositories allow for datasets to
be embargoed. Data sets may be embargoed for a number of reasons. For
example, the researchers may not wish to publish their data until the
accompanying article is available, or they may be pursuing a patent
based on their discoveries.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the types of data repositories that researchers can use for
sharing data:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Specialist data repository.</strong> Specialist data
repositories accept scholarships from certain disciplines or on a
specific topic. These include <a href="https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/" class="external-link">ICPSR</a>, the inter-university
consortium for political and social research.</li>
<li>
<strong>Generalist data repository.</strong> Generalist data
repositories accept any scholarship from any discipline. These include
<a href="https://figshare.com/" class="external-link">Figshare</a>, <a href="https://zenodo.org/" class="external-link">Zenodo</a>, <a href="https://data.mendeley.com/" class="external-link">Mendeley</a>, and <a href="https://osf.io/" class="external-link">OSF</a>. Other generalist repositories include <a href="https://vivli.org/" class="external-link">Vivli</a>, which only accepts clinical data,
and <a href="https://datadryad.org/" class="external-link">Dryad</a>, which primarily accepts
data from the sciences.</li>
<li>
<strong>Institutional data repository.</strong> Some institutions
host their own data repository to encourage their researchers to deposit
data. These are typically limited to affiliates of the host institution,
though you should check if your researcher’s collaborators are
affiliated with an institution hosting a data repository. Other
institutional repositories, like the <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/" class="external-link">Harvard Dataverse</a>, allow any
researcher to deposit their datasets regardless of affiliation.</li>
</ul>
<div id="callout2" class="callout">
<div class="callout-square">
<i class="callout-icon" data-feather="bell"></i>
</div>
<div class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">Callout</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>Institutional repositories vary in their ability to accept and
maintain data. Before commiting to using an institutional repository,
check that they routinely accept data.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Recommending a data repository for inclusion in a DMP can be
challenging. Generally, it is best to recommend a specialist repository,
followed by an institutional or generalist repository. Here are some
tools to help you find the right data repository for your
researcher:</p>
<figure><img src="fig/Copy%20of%20Repository%20choice%20flow%20chart.png" alt="This chart shows a basic workflow to help you choose a repository" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">This chart shows a basic workflow to help you
choose a repository</div>
</figure><ul>
<li>
<strong>Repository indices.</strong> Locating the right data
repository for your researcher among the thousands in existence may be
challenging, especially if you are not familiar with where others in the
discipline are depositing their datasets. Luckily, there are a number of
repository indices that aggregate data repositories and provide filters
to facilitate pinpointing the one that works best for your researcher.
<a href="https://fairsharing.org/" class="external-link">FAIRsharing</a> and <a href="https://www.re3data.org/" class="external-link">re3data</a> are good starting points
when you are not aware if a specialist repository exists for a given
discipline.</li>
<li>
<strong>Funder recommendations.</strong> Some funders like the <a href="https://professional.heart.org/en/research-programs/awardee-policies/aha-approved-data-repositories" class="external-link">AHA</a>
or the <a href="https://sharing.nih.gov/data-management-and-sharing-policy/sharing-scientific-data/repositories-for-sharing-scientific-data" class="external-link">NIH
provide recommendations</a> for where their funded projects should share
their data after the active research phase has concluded– the <a href="https://www.nnlm.gov/finder" class="external-link">NNLM Data Repository Finder</a>
provides more guidance for finding an NIH-supported repository.</li>
<li>
<strong>Publisher recommendations.</strong> For researchers without
funding or whose funders provided no guidance on which data repositories
to use, some publishers like <a href="https://www.nature.com/sdata/policies/repositories" class="external-link">Nature have
requirements</a> where researchers should deposit their data before
their articles are published.</li>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.nnlm.gov/guides/data-glossary/data-standards" class="external-link">NNLM
data glossary</a>, a data standard is “a type of standard, which is an
agreed upon approach to allow for consistent measurement, qualification
or exchange of an object, process, or unit of information. […] Data
standards refer to methods of organizing, documenting, and formatting
data in order to aid in data aggregation, sharing and reuse.”</p>
<p>Data standards help to promote the FAIR principles. By using a data
standard when creating and describing their data, researchers make their
data easier to discover and reuse. For instance, if you use a
standardized survey instrument when collecting data, your data can be
easily compared and combined with the results of other researchers using
the same instrument.</p>
<p>Some of the most common data management questions data librarians
receive revolve around standards. Many researchers, even if they support
the principles of open science, are not trained to find and utilize data
standards. Often, they are not thinking about their process from the
point of view of data reuse. For librarians, data standards present an
opportunity for us to educate researchers.</p>
<p>There are many types of data standards, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>File type.</strong> When curating a dataset to share,
researchers should convert their data to an <a href="https://opendatahandbook.org/guide/en/appendices/file-formats/" class="external-link">open
file format</a>. For instance, spreadsheets should be made available as
a CSV rather than an excel document (XLSX). Using standardized open file
types is a data standard.</li>
<li>
<strong>Controlled vocabularies/ontologies.</strong> A controlled
vocabulary ensures data standardization by limiting the number of terms
that can be used in a given field. Librarians often use controlled
vocabularies when cataloging, for example <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/" class="external-link">MESH</a> for medical subject
terms, or the <a href="https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/index.html" class="external-link">Getty
AAT</a> for art terms. Researchers can also use controlled vocabularies
in their work to ensure interoperability across studies.</li>
<li>
<strong>Minimum information.</strong> Minimum information standards,
such as the <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/5706412" class="external-link">MINSEQE</a>,
specify the minimum amount of metadata and data required for different
data types. This helps to facilitate reuse and prevent mystery datasets
without documentation from coming into a repository.</li>
<li>
<strong>Metadata schema.</strong> A metadata schema defines the
elements of metadata for an object and how those elements can be used to
describe a specific resource. Many librarians are familiar with metadata
schemas such as <a href="https://www.loc.gov/marc/" class="external-link">MARC</a> or <a href="https://www.dublincore.org/" class="external-link">Dublin Core</a>, but there are also
specialized metadata schemas for particular research fields.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finding appropriate data standards can be tricky for both librarians
and researchers. The data standard landscape is still evolving, and the
availability of data standards varies widely by field. There may be no
widely accepted standard for a researcher’s project. If there is a lack
of appropriate data standards, this information should be included in
the DMP.</p>
<p>One strategy when answering reference questions about data standards
is to work backwards. If you or the researcher have already picked out a
data repository, look in the documentation of that repository to find
what data standards they are using. For example, the <a href="https://nda.nih.gov/" class="external-link">NIMH National Data Archive</a> has a page
describing their data standards.</p>

data standards:</p>

<p>So far, we have covered what a data management plan looks like, what
each subsection contains, and where to locate resources that connect to
the researcher’s specific need. In this section, we pivot from learning
about DMPs into how to apply this knowledge when serving patrons. We
will provide insights into common questions and concerns researchers
have about the DMP process, and describe strategies on how to
effectively conduct a data interview.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.nnlm.gov/guides/data-glossary/data-interview" class="external-link">NNLM’s
data glossary</a>, “a data interview in the library context refers to an
interaction between a librarian and a researcher with a structured or
semi-structured set of questions designed to elicit information about
the researcher’s data practices and/or needs.” This process is
essentially a specialized subcategory of the reference interview, and is
a good first step in helping a researcher prepare a DMP.</p>
<p>Just like the reference interview begins with establishing a
background purpose (“what is this information being used for”), you
might want to begin broadly by asking researchers about their project
and its purpose. This can help you to begin formulating follow-up
questions that will extrapolate the researcher’s needs.</p>

<div class="callout-content">
<p>Let’s say that the researcher responds with “I am running a project
about the impact of pets on the emotional well-being of children” to the
question “what is the purpose of your research”.</p>
<p>What has this short response told you about the researcher’s project
and needs?</p>

<p>Children are the subject of the research, so it is a human subject’s
study. This means that researcher will probably need additional
accommodations if they want to share their dataset. Children are also a
protected population, which needs to be taken account when trying to
answer the question should data be shared. Based on the information
provided it is unclear what format the data will be in (Observational
notes? Quantitative questionnaire responses? Qualitative interviews?
Other?), and will therefore need to be explored more during the
conversation.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Even short responses can give you an idea of who/what is the subject
of the research, how sensitive this data may be, and the potential
formats of the data. Even with this short response, you have already
found out this is a human subjects study, and that this researcher will
need additional accommodations if they want to share their dataset. Like
in a reference interview, it is useful to paraphrase the project back to
the researcher and ask clarifying questions to make sure you have a good
grasp of the research purpose.</p>
<p>After establishing the purpose of the project, it is helpful to ask
about where the researcher is applying for grant funding and their
timeline for submitting materials. Researchers who are not applying for
grant funding can still benefit from writing a data management plan, and
these questions can help them consider their project needs and what
workflows need to be put into place.</p>
<p>Next, we move on to follow-up questions that relate to the DMP
sections. Like in a reference interview, these questions move from
open-ended to closed, specific questions to clarify needs not raised by
the researcher. Use the purpose of the project to inform your questions,
and help the researcher think through their workflow and needs.
Sometimes the researcher will answer “I am not sure”. This is an
opportunity to explore what they think they will do, and to provide some
options as to how they may proceed. Remind the researcher that a DMP can
(and should) be updated as necessary to better align with their
procedures as the project evolves.</p>

<p>Proprietary software is owned by an organization that requires a
license or a fee to access. Typically, this software will generate files
formats specific to it (such as Excel .xlsx), and it might be difficult
to open or manipulate it using other software. Converting these data
files into an open format, a version that is easily accessible by many
pieces of software, makes data more FAIR (such as from .xlsx to .csv or
.tsv). For a list of open access file formats, please see the resources

researcher and librarian or other support staff. The website includes
links to funder requirements and sample plans. Researchers can create
plans in a wizard that includes side-by-side instruction. Participating
institutions have the option of preparing templates with customized
guidance for their institution and utilizing the feedback system to
review plans by request.</p>

</h3>
<p><strong>How can you tell?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The DMP reads like several different projects</li>
<li>The verbally stated goals of the project are not aligned with what
is written in the DMP</li>
<li>The action items in the DMP are not appropriate for the project</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why this is an issue:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>By copying and pasting existing language, researchers may not
understand what they are promising the granting agency</li>
<li>Researchers also miss out on examining their own processes and
creating a plan that fits with their workflow</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Constructive feedback:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>In a consultation</em>, ask the researcher if they used language
from another template or plan, and if they understood everything they
were proposing. Go through each section and use the data interview
questions in Episode 3 to help the researcher customize the plan to
their needs.</li>
<li>
<em>In the DMPTool or email</em>, call out the sections that do not
make sense for the project. Suggest that they consider how to modify the
template language to better fit with their project workflow and make it
easier to follow-through to meet funder requirements. Offer to schedule
a consultation to discuss this more in person.</li>

</h3>
<p><strong>How can you tell?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Listed information includes “laboratory notebooks, preliminary
analyses, drafts of scientific papers, plans for future research, peer
review reports, communications with colleagues, or physical objects,
such as laboratory specimens”, which do not fall under the research data
definition (OMB circular A-110)</li>
<li>Includes other information that does not fall under this definition
include evaluating student performance or courses as part of the project
(data reported to the institution)</li>
<li>Lists other scholarship generated as part of this research project,
such as which journals will be targeted for articles publications and
which conferences will be attended to present findings</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why this is an issue:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Non-research data has no place in a DMP. It does not need to be
publicly accessible or preserved as part of funding requirements</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Constructive feedback:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Provide researchers with the research data definition, identify
which information does not fall within the definition, and suggest that
they remove it from their plan</li>

<p><strong>How can you tell?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There is no information about what data will be collected or what
tools will be used to collect this information</li>
<li>There is no information about file formats and types</li>
<li>There are no files size estimates</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why this is an issue:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is difficult to plan for data management if the data to be
generated within a project is not specified</li>
<li>It is possible that researchers do not have a good understanding of
what counts as research data, which will make follow through on the plan
difficult</li>
<li>It is also possible that researchers do not want to provide
estimates or assumptions, but lack of information prevents the funding
agency from understanding their project fully</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Constructive feedback:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Using the information in Episode 1, state what information you were
hoping to see in this section. It may also be helpful to provide sample
language to give researchers a sense of what level of detail is expected
in this section</li>
<li>Offer to schedule a consultation to help the researcher brainstorm
what data might be generated as part of their project. Remind them that
their best estimates should be included for now, and that the DMP can be
updated once they have solidified their workflow</li>

<li>Information in this section is incorrect</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why this is an issue:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing a dataset without metadata to explain variables and provide
context renders it useless to those trying to reuse it</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Constructive feedback:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Using the information in Episode 2, suggest standards to the
researcher. You might also provide sample language from Episode 1 to
give researchers a better idea of how others have filled out this
section</li>
<li>Ask researchers to consider what the minimum information they need
to provide so that colleagues can understand their variables and

information<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-access-and-reuse-section-does-not-contain-sufficient-data-information"></a>
</h3>
<p><strong>How can you tell?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The researcher states that data will not be shared and provides no
further information</li>
<li>The researcher does not provide any information about data sharing,
only that it will be destroyed (or maintained privately)</li>
<li>The researcher states that data will be shared only after a specific
event later than the time specified by the funder guidelines (e.g.,
researcher retirement, researcher death)</li>
<li>The researcher is overly restrictive in sharing nonsensitive data
(eg., animal studies)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why this is an issue:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Federally-funded research uses tax-payer money, and thus, should be
made accessible to the public as widely and as soon as possible.
Limiting the sharing of research results also limits research
advancement through collaboration and limits the public’s access to
information. Sometimes data sharing is not possible because of the
sensitive nature of the dataset. However, reasons for not sharing the
dataset in a limited capacity (in aggregate, by using extra precautions
such as data use agreements or controlled access repositories) needs to
be clearly stated. Omitting this information prevents the funding agency
from understanding their project accurately</li>
<li>Not sharing because of the additional labor involved or the lack of
data sharing within the discipline are not adequate reasons</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Constructive feedback:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Introduce the researcher to the concept of a data repository,
explaining that it provides long-term sustainable access to datasets for
free</li>
<li>Ask researchers if there are any specific reasons why they cannot
share their data. Encourage them to state these reasons clearly if the
data is sensitive. Otherwise, using the information in Episode 2, make
repository recommendations (prioritizing a specialist repository over an
institutional or generalist repository)</li>

<h3 id="the-location-of-dataset-sharing-provided-in-the-access-and-reuse-section-is-unsustainable">The location of dataset sharing provided in the Access and Reuse

</h3>
<p><strong>How can you tell?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The researcher states that they will make the data available in the
supplementary files as part of the article publication</li>
<li>The researcher states that they will make the data available on
their personal or university website</li>
<li>The researcher states that they will build their own repository for
storing the data</li>
<li>The researcher states that they will make the data available by
request</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why this is an issue:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As stated in Episode 2, making the dataset available as a
supplementary file or on a personal website is not advisable because the
long term sustainability of the website is unknown: it can be updated or
taken down without warning</li>
<li>Making the data available only by request is also not sustainable
because it requires the researcher to find, evaluate and curate the data
every time it is requested. Moreover, email addresses change when
researchers move institutions or retire. Studies have demonstrated a
lack of author compliance when data is actually requested.</li>
<li>Building their own repository for storing data is unsustainable
because it requires time, resources, and maintenance. There is no need
to reinvent the wheel when there are data repositories maintained by
well-funded entities that are free to use.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Constructive feedback:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Introduce the researcher to the concept of a data repository,
explaining that it provides long-term sustainable access to datasets for
free</li>
<li>Ask researchers if they are aware of any funder or publisher data
repository recommendations that they can follow. Otherwise, make
repository recommendations using the information in Episode 2.</li>

<p>Now that you have learned about DMPs and how to address common
issues, you are prepared to think about how to implement support at your
institution. This lesson covers options for data management planning
services and how to implement a new data program. It is important to
keep in mind that the information in this module was drawn from the
authors’ own experiences as data librarians and not all of the options
may be applicable for your institution.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>When embarking on a new data service in the library, often the first
step is to contact stakeholders at your institution. These are
individuals who support related services in their own departments, and
can give you ideas for what gaps exist at your institution, and how you
can most effectively implement or publicize your new program. Some
stakeholders will be people you likely already know from your library
work, and some may be new to you. Please note offices and groups may go
by different names at your institution than the examples provided
below.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Research and funding.</strong> This includes the Office of
Research, Office of Undergraduate/Graduate Research, Research Institute,
Research Administration, Grants Management, and Office of Sponsored
Programs (or your local equivalent). These offices usually have contact
with a variety of researchers at your institution and will have
information on their needs. They may also be partners for presentations
or publicity.</li>
<li>
<strong>Compliance.</strong> This includes Institutional Review
Board (IRB), Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), the
Research Integrity Officer (RIO), and Regulatory Affairs (or local
equivalents). These offices usually work on ensuring that researchers
are following funder mandates on data sharing.</li>
<li>
<strong>Research IT.</strong> This includes Research Computing,
High-Performance Computing, and Information Security (or local
equivalents). Your research IT can inform about options for data storage
and sharing on campus. It’s also helpful to have a contact person there
to refer questions to.</li>
<li>
<strong>Data and Statistical Analysis.</strong> This includes
Statistical Consulting, Biostatistics, and Institutional Statisticians
(or local equivalents). These people are useful contacts for referring
out questions on statistical analysis. They may also be able to point
out common issues that researchers are facing that can be addressed via
library instruction.</li>
<li>
<strong>Research Support Services.</strong> This includes the Office
of Teaching and Learning, Research Coordinators, Research Training, and
liaison librarians (or local equivalent). These units already teach and
support researchers, and may have insights into knowledge gaps. You can
also cross-promote any events.</li>
<li>
<strong>Anyone involved in intellectual property or data
licensing.</strong> The offices involved in this area vary widely by
institution, but can include the General Counsel or the Office of
Intellectual Property. These people are helpful to refer out questions
on data licensing, patents, or institutional data use agreements
(DUAs).</li>

<p>Like all varieties of librarian, data librarians have their own
organizations and networking groups. Joining some of these groups can be
a great way to get support as someone new to the field. Here are some
options to get you started:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://datacurationnetwork.org/" class="external-link">Data Curation Network</a>
– Data curation network provides resources and professional education
opportunities for anyone working in data curation, data management, or
data repositories.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.nnlm.gov/about/centers/ncds" class="external-link">NNLM National
Center for Data Services</a> – Provides education, training and
resources for data librarians in the health sciences.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://rdapassociation.org/" class="external-link">Research Data Access and
Preservation Association (RDAP)</a> – Professional association for those
creating, maintaining, advancing and teaching best practices for
research data, access and preservation. RDAP has a very useful
listserv.</li>

Organization of member institutions devoted to enabling open sharing and
reuse of data. Provides training and events.</li>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="data-management-plan-consultations">Data Management Plan Consultations<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#data-management-plan-consultations"></a>
</h3>
<p>In libraries that provide DMP services, the most common offerings are
data management plan consultations. We discussed how to provide a data
consultation in Episode 3. Research data consultations can be an easy
way to integrate DMP support into your offerings, as these questions can
be asked during regular research consultations or email communications
to determine research needs. Keep in mind that it is important to build
up your network of internal data stakeholders before taking on data
reference, since it is common for questions to be referred out to other
units at your institution.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="dmp-draft-review">DMP Draft Review<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#dmp-draft-review"></a>
</h3>
<p>Many libraries also review drafts of data management plans after they
are written. This includes cross-checking the DMPs with any funding
agency requirements, and review of completeness and feasibility. DMP
review can also be done through the DMPTool, as detailed in Episode 4.
When establishing a DMP draft review service, it is important to
consider how you will balance completing the reviews with your current
workload. Many researchers write DMPs for grants at the last minute, and
so some libraries have implemented rules to limit requests with a tight
turnaround time. For example, you may want to enact a policy requiring
DMP review requests to be submitted a week or more before the grant
deadline.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="educational-programming">Educational Programming<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#educational-programming"></a>
</h3>
<p>In addition to providing one-on-one services for individual
researchers, you may want to incorporate larger educational programs on
DMPs. Librarians can incorporate asynchronous education by creating
libguides linking to DMP resources, or providing instructions on how to
write DMPs for specific granting agencies (e.g. the NIH, NSF). Using the
<a href="https://community.libguides.com/" class="external-link">LibGuides Community</a>
mentioned in Episode 2, you can find and remix a DMP libguide that
serves your community’s needs best. Libraries can also target audiences
synchronously by providing webinars or education sessions on writing a
DMP, DMP policies or requirements, and using the DMPTool.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="marketing">Marketing<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#marketing"></a>
</h3>
<p>As with any other new library program, you will need to market your
DMP services. For example, you might use flyers, email lists, digital
signage, or postcards through the campus mail. Successful marketing
strategies vary from institution to institution, and you know your
institution best. However, taking advantage of your stakeholder network
to reach out to data-intensive researchers is important for successfully
marketing a data program.</p>
