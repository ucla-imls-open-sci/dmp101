## Introduction

[DMPTool](https://dmptool.org/) is a free, open-source, online application that helps researchers create data management plans. The tool provides a click-through wizard for creating a DMP that complies with funder requirements. DMPTool is a service run by the California Digital Library. 

The DMPTool is meant to be a one-stop shop that benefits both the researcher and librarian or other support staff. The website includes links to funder requirements and sample plans. Researchers can create plans in a wizard that includes side-by-side instruction. Participating institutions have the option of preparing templates with customized guidance for their institution and utilizing the feedback system to review plans by request.

## Common DMP Issues

When you begin assisting researchers with thinking about data management planning and revising their DMPs, you will begin noticing trends that will make issues easier to spot in the future. Below are some common issues, how they can be identified, and constructive feedback that can be provided to improve the DMP.

::::::::::::::::::::::: callout
Please note that constructive feedback may differ if the research agrees to a consultation, or if you are providing feedback through email or the DMPTool.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Language was copied from another project or template without modifications

**How can you tell?**

- The DMP reads like several different projects
- The verbally-stated goals of the project are not aligned with what is written in the DMP
- The action items in the DMP do not make sense for the project

**Why this is an issue:**

- By copying and pasting existing language exactly, researchers may not understand what they are promising the granting agency
- Researchers also miss out on examining their own processes and creating a plan that fits with their workflow

**Constructive feedback:**

- *In a consultation*, ask the researcher if they used language from another template or plan, and if they understood everything they were proposing. Go through each section and use the data interview questions in Episode 3 to help the researcher customize the plan to their needs
- *In the DMPTool or email*, call out the sections that do not make sense for the project. Suggest that they consider how to modify the template language to better fit with their project workflow and make it easier to follow-through to meet funder requirements. Offer to schedule a consultation to discuss this more in person.

### Including additional information that does not qualify as research data 

**How can you tell?**

- Listed information includes “laboratory notebooks, preliminary analyses, drafts of scientific papers, plans for future research, peer review reports, communications with colleagues, or physical objects, such as laboratory specimens”, which do not fall under the research data definition (OMB circular A-110)
- Other information that does not fall under this definition include evaluating student performance or courses as part of the project (data reported to the institution)
- Lists other scholarship generated as part of this research project, such as which journals will be targeted for articles publications and which conferences will be attended to present findings

**Why this is an issue:**

- Non-research data has no place in a DMP. It does not need to be publicly accessible or preserved as part of funding requirements

**Constructive feedback:**

- Provide researchers with the research data definition, identify which information does not fall within the definition, and suggest that they remove it from their plan

### The Data Description and Format section does not contain sufficient data information

**How can you tell?**

- There is no information about what data will be collected or what tools will be used to collect this information
- There is no information about file formats and types
- There are no files size estimates

**Why this is an issue:**

- It is difficult to plan for data management if the data to be generated within a project is not specified
- It is possible that researchers do not have a good understanding of what counts as research data, which will make follow through on the plan difficult
- It is also possible that researchers do not want to provide estimates or assumptions, but lack of information prevents the funding agency from understanding their project accurately

**Constructive feedback:**

- Using the information in Episode 1, state what information you were hoping to see in this section. It may also be helpful to provide sample language to give researchers a better idea of how others have filled out this section
- Offer to schedule a consultation to help the researcher brainstorm what data might be generated as part of their project. Remind them that their best estimates should be included for now, and that the DMP can be updated later on when they have solidified their workflow

### The Metadata and Data Standards section does not contain sufficient data information

**How can you tell?**

- The section has been completely omitted
- There is no information included about disciplinary standards
- There is no information included about metadata
- Information in this section is incorrect

**Why this is an issue:**

- Sharing a dataset without metadata to explain variables and provide context renders it useless to those trying to reuse it

**Constructive feedback:**

- Using the information in Episode 2, it might be helpful to define standards. You might also provide sample language from Episode 1 to give researchers a better idea of how others have filled out this section
- Ask researchers to consider what the minimum information they need to provide so that their colleagues can understand their variables and replicate their analyses
- Ask researchers if there are any controlled vocabularies within their discipline that they will be using as part of their project

### The Access and Reuse section does not contain sufficient data information

**How can you tell?**

- The researcher states that data will not be shared and provides no further information
- The researcher does not provide any information about data sharing, only that it will be destroyed
- The researcher states that data will be shared only after a specific event which is not the end of the active research phase (researcher retirement, researcher death)
- The researcher is overly restrictive in data sharing for nonsensitive data (eg., animal studies)

**Why this is an issue:**

- Federally-funded research uses tax-payer money, and thus, should be made accessible to the public as widely and as soon as possible. Limiting the sharing of research results also limits research advancement through collaboration and limits the public’s access to information that was only made possible because of them. Sometimes data sharing is not possible because of the sensitive nature of the dataset. However, reasons for not sharing the dataset in a limited capacity (in aggregate, by using extra precautions such as data use agreements or controlled access repositories) needs to be clearly stated. Omitting this information prevents the funding agency from understanding their project accurately
- Not sharing because of the additional labor involved or the lack of data sharing within the discipline are not adequate reasons

**Constructive feedback:**

- Introduce the researcher to the concept of a data repository, explaining that it provides long-term sustainable access to datasets for free
- Ask researchers if there are any specific reasons why they cannot share their data. Encourage them to state these reasons clearly if the data is sensitive. Otherwise, using the information in Episode 2, recommend the repositories in order from specialist repository, followed by an institutional or generalist repository

### The location of dataset sharing provided in the Access and Reuse section is unsustainable

**How can you tell?**

- The researcher states that they will make the data available in the supplementary files as part of the article publication
- The researcher states that they will make the data available on their personal or university website
- The researcher states that they will build their own repository for storing the data
- The researcher states that they will make the data available by request

**Why this is an issue:**

- As stated in Episode 2, making the dataset available as a supplementary file or on a personal website is not advisable because the long term sustainability of the website is unknown: it can be updated or taken down without warning
- Making the data available only by request is also not sustainable because it requires the researcher to find, evaluate and curate the data every time it is requested. Moreover, email addresses change when researchers move institutions or retire. Studies have also demonstrated a lack of author compliance when data is actually requested.
- Building their own repository for storing data is unsustainable because it requires time, resources, and maintenance over time. There is no need to reinvent the wheel when there are data repositories maintained by well-funded entities that are free to use.

**Constructive feedback:**

- Introduce the researcher to the concept of a data repository, explaining that it provides long-term sustainable access to datasets for free
- Ask researchers if they are aware of any funder or publisher data repository recommendations that they can follow. Otherwise, using the information in Episode 2, recommend the repositories in order from specialist repository, followed by an institutional or generalist repository
